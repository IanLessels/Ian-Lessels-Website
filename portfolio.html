    <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/328032824/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my First Scratch project, it is a game with the objective of the player clicking the target on the screen. There are 4 different difficulty modes for different types of players. The harder the gamemode, the faster the target moves around the screen. Our last gamemode is made with a sprite following around the cursor of the player. This makes it so that when the mouse of the player touches the target, the sprite following the cursor will soon reach the target. Once the sprite following the cursor touches the target, the target is sent the message to move to a different location.

    <img src="gpa.png" height="250">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my group's MIT App inventor project. The function of our app is to calculate the gpa of your entire highschool career. To calculate your gpa, you just have to enter what grades you got throughout your classes into our 6 catagories(0.0-5.0). After you have entered all of your classes, just press get gpa, and your gpa will show in the text box. If you want to calculate another gpa, make sure to press the reset button first.</p>

    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my first python project. It is an interactive story that allows the viewer/ reader to make choices that affect the outcome of the story. The entire code is print statements to comunicate with the reader and if else statements that the reader has an effect on. The goal of this specific story is to rescue a princess that is locked in a tower. There are many obsticles along the way that may result in death if you choose wrong. To get the winning outcome, it may take you a couple tries to figure the story out. Good Luck! </p>
    <h2 style="font-size:200%;">This my second python project:</h2>
    <img src="python gpa calculator.PNG" height="750">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my second python project. This project was a GPA calculator that calculates one semester of your high school career. For it to calculate your GPA, you have to answer a few questions about what grades you got in your classes. Then, once you have entered all of the values, it will give you your GPA. Restarting the program is simple, all you have to do is re-run the program.</p>

    <img src="Killer Whale Code image.PNG" height="500">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my image manipulation project. My partner and I took an image of a Killer Whale and changed the color of the sky and the color of the water in three different images. The original image of the whale is on top of the 3 modified versions. Also, the code that we created to change the images is below the 3 modified versions of the image. At first we had only modified the sky behind the killer whale, then we thought of changing the color of the water afterwards.</p>
    <h2 style="font-size:200%;">Data Analysis Project:</h2>
    <img src="data project pie chart.PNG" height="250">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my pie chart about voters in the united states. The question that we asked was what percentage of people voted for either donald trump or clinton vs. people who were registered to vote and didn't vote. The source we got our data from official 2016 Presidential General Election Results by the States Election Office. The template that we used for the pie chart was from My Pltw. In the end, our pie chart die answer our question on what percentage of people voted because the pie chart clearly showed the sizes of slices.</p> 
    <h2 style="font-size:200%;">NetLogo Simulation 2 Lane Traffic:</h2>
    <img src="2 Lane Traffic simulation image.PNG" height="250">
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my simulation project on NetLogo. We took an existing simulation on how two lane traffic works and modified it. One of the first modifications we made was that we added on more lane to the road. This would increase the amount of merging because there are more lanes and when we add another lane, it also allows more cars to be on the road. The second modification that we made was adding a "Merging lane." This merging lane would give the cars a place to go when they want to merge, but the lane they are trying to merge into is still blocked. This tests wether merging when there isn't space slows down traffic.</p>
