    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my First Scratch project, it is a game with the objective of the player clicking the target on the screen. There are 4 different difficulty modes for different types of players. The harder the gamemode, the faster the target moves around the screen. Our last gamemode is made with a sprite following around the cursor of the player. This makes it so that when the mouse of the player touches the target, the sprite following the cursor will soon reach the target. Once the sprite following the cursor touches the target, the target is sent the message to move to a different location.

    <p style="font-size:200%;"> This is my group's MIT App inventor project. The function of our app is to calculate the gpa of your entire highschool career. To calculate your gpa, you just have to enter what grades you got throughout your classes into our 6 catagories(0.0-5.0). After you have entered all of your classes, just press get gpa, and your gpa will show in the text box. If you want to calculate another gpa, make sure to press the reset button first.</p>
